# Transactional Fraud Detection System
> Transactional Fraud Detection System using SpringBoot and ELK Stack

To get data for the **Transactional Fraud Detection System** (Project 3), you need to follow a few essential steps to gather transactional data, process it, detect anomalies, and then send it to Elasticsearch for monitoring and visualization in Kibana. Here's how you can break it down:

### **1. Data Generation or Integration**

In a real-world application, transactional data will come from payment systems, online stores, or banking APIs. Since we’re building a fraud detection system, you need a source of **transactional data**. You can either:
- **Use a mock data generator** to simulate transactions.
- **Integrate with a real payment system** (for a more realistic scenario, e.g., PayPal, Stripe, or a bank API).

Here’s a breakdown of data points typically included in a transaction:
- **Transaction ID**: Unique identifier for the transaction.
- **User ID**: The customer making the transaction.
- **Amount**: The amount being transacted.
- **Timestamp**: Date and time the transaction occurred.
- **Location**: Where the transaction took place (can be GPS coordinates or a city).
- **Payment Method**: E.g., Credit Card, Debit Card, PayPal, etc.
- **Device Information**: Device type, IP address, browser type (optional but useful for fraud detection).
- **Merchant ID**: The entity receiving the transaction.
- **Transaction Status**: E.g., success, failure, pending.

#### Example of mock transactional data:
```json
{
  "transactionId": "TX123456789",
  "userId": "user123",
  "amount": 200,
  "timestamp": "2025-02-11T15:45:00Z",
  "location": "New York, NY",
  "paymentMethod": "Credit Card",
  "device": "Desktop",
  "merchantId": "merchantXYZ",
  "status": "success"
}
```

### **2. Building Spring Boot Backend for Data Processing**

You can create a Spring Boot application to:
- **Handle incoming transactions** (via REST APIs or message queues like Kafka).
- **Store transactions** into a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL) or directly into Elasticsearch.
- **Implement fraud detection logic** (e.g., check for unusual transaction amounts, location mismatches, multiple transactions from different locations in a short period).

**Step 1: Spring Boot Project Setup**
- Start a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr.
- Add dependencies such as:
  - Spring Web
  - Spring Data Elasticsearch
  - Spring Security (for user authentication)
  - Spring Boot Actuator (for monitoring metrics)

```xml
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-data-elasticsearch</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

**Step 2: Transaction Model & Elasticsearch Mapping**
You’ll need a **Transaction** model that will represent your data structure.

```java
@Document(indexName = "transactions")
public class Transaction {
    @Id
    private String transactionId;
    private String userId;
    private double amount;
    private String timestamp;
    private String location;
    private String paymentMethod;
    private String device;
    private String merchantId;
    private String status;

    // Getters and Setters
}
```

This class is annotated with `@Document`, which tells Spring Data Elasticsearch to store this object in the Elasticsearch index `transactions`.

**Step 3: Elasticsearch Repository**
Create a repository interface for your **Transaction** model.

```java
public interface TransactionRepository extends ElasticsearchRepository<Transaction, String> {
    List<Transaction> findByUserId(String userId);
    List<Transaction> findByLocation(String location);
}
```

### **3. Fraud Detection Logic**

In this system, the fraud detection logic can be based on various rules or even machine learning models. Some possible fraud detection checks could be:
- **Geographical Anomaly**: A transaction from a location that’s far from the user’s typical location.
- **High Transaction Amount**: Transactions above a certain amount could be flagged for review.
- **Frequent Transactions**: Multiple transactions within a short time frame could be flagged as suspicious.

Here’s a simple example of fraud detection in the service layer:

```java
@Service
public class FraudDetectionService {

    private final TransactionRepository transactionRepository;

    public FraudDetectionService(TransactionRepository transactionRepository) {
        this.transactionRepository = transactionRepository;
    }

    // Example check for same user making multiple high-value transactions within a short time.
    public boolean isSuspicious(Transaction transaction) {
        List<Transaction> recentTransactions = transactionRepository.findByUserId(transaction.getUserId());

        // Check if there are recent transactions within the last 5 minutes
        long currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
        long fiveMinutesAgo = currentTime - 5 * 60 * 1000;

        long recentCount = recentTransactions.stream()
                .filter(t -> t.getTimestamp() > fiveMinutesAgo && t.getAmount() > 1000)
                .count();

        if (recentCount > 2) {
            return true; // Suspicious
        }
        return false; // Not suspicious
    }
}
```

### **4. Sending Data to Elasticsearch**

After processing the data (and possibly detecting fraud), send it to Elasticsearch using Spring Data Elasticsearch.

```java
@Service
public class TransactionService {

    private final TransactionRepository transactionRepository;
    private final FraudDetectionService fraudDetectionService;

    public TransactionService(TransactionRepository transactionRepository, FraudDetectionService fraudDetectionService) {
        this.transactionRepository = transactionRepository;
        this.fraudDetectionService = fraudDetectionService;
    }

    public void processTransaction(Transaction transaction) {
        // Fraud detection logic
        boolean suspicious = fraudDetectionService.isSuspicious(transaction);
        transaction.setStatus(suspicious ? "fraudulent" : "successful");

        // Save the transaction to Elasticsearch
        transactionRepository.save(transaction);

        if (suspicious) {
            // You can also trigger alerts or other actions here
            System.out.println("Fraudulent transaction detected: " + transaction.getTransactionId());
        }
    }
}
```

### **5. Visualizing the Data in Kibana**

Once your data is stored in Elasticsearch, you can use Kibana to visualize and monitor it:
- **Transaction Overview**: Create a dashboard showing the total number of transactions, total amount, and number of fraudulent transactions.
- **Geographical Trends**: Use location data to visualize transaction activity on a map.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Set up visualizations for suspicious activity or high-risk transactions (e.g., large amounts, multiple purchases in short time).

### **6. Monitoring and Alerting**

Set up **Kibana Alerts** or **Elasticsearch Watcher** to notify administrators when fraud is detected or when transaction thresholds are crossed (e.g., high number of failed transactions).

---

### **Summary**

To get data for **Project 3 (Transactional Fraud Detection System)**:
1. **Simulate or collect transactional data** either by generating it manually or integrating with payment systems.
2. **Set up a Spring Boot application** to process transactions, apply fraud detection rules, and store data in Elasticsearch.
3. **Build fraud detection logic** using business rules or machine learning models.
4. **Store data in Elasticsearch** and use **Kibana** to visualize and monitor transactions in real-time.
5. **Set up alerts** to notify when suspicious activities are detected.
