# Transactional Fraud Detection System Design using Spring Boot and ELK

To build a **Transactional Fraud Detection System** using **Spring Boot** and **ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana)**, we can follow a structured approach for both low-level and high-level architecture diagrams. Below are the details for both:

## System Design Template for Transactional Fraud Detection

### High-Level System Design Template:

#### 1. **External Systems (Payment Gateway/Users):**
   - This is where the transactions originate (e.g., User requests or Payment Gateway submissions).

#### 2. **Spring Boot Application:**
   - **Transaction Processing Service**: The core component to receive, validate, and forward transactions.
   - **Transaction Validation**: Ensures the authenticity and integrity of the transaction.
   - **Logging Service**: Integrates with Elasticsearch to store transactional logs.

#### 3. **Elasticsearch (ELK Stack):**
   - **Logstash**: Collects and processes logs.
   - **Elasticsearch**: Stores processed data in a centralized data store.
   - **Kibana**: Visualizes and monitors data, alerting for abnormal behavior.

#### 4. **Fraud Detection Engine:**
   - A specialized component that checks the transactions against pre-configured rules.
   - **Rules Engine**: Applies fraud detection algorithms or rules.

#### 5. **Fraud Alert System:**
   - Generates alerts based on detection results (e.g., fraud detected or suspicious activity).
   - Sends notifications to admins or users.

#### 6. **Kibana (Monitoring & Analysis):**
   - Monitors system performance, transaction logs, and fraud alerts.
   - Provides real-time dashboards for the admin team.

### High-Level Architecture Flow (Components)

1. **External Systems**: Initiates transactions.
2. **Spring Boot Application**: Validates and forwards the transactions.
3. **Elasticsearch**: Logs and stores transaction details.
4. **Fraud Detection Engine**: Determines if a transaction is legitimate.
5. **Fraud Alert System**: Raises alerts based on fraud detection results.
6. **Kibana**: Provides visualization for monitoring and reporting.

### Low-Level Architecture:

#### Transaction Lifecycle:

1. **Transaction Received**: External system sends the transaction to Spring Boot.
2. **Validation**: Spring Boot validates the transaction data.
3. **Logging**: Data is stored in Elasticsearch for real-time tracking.
4. **Fraud Detection**: Transactions are analyzed using predefined rules in the Fraud Detection Engine.
5. **Fraud Decision Gateway**: Checks if the transaction is flagged as fraudulent or legitimate.
6. **Alert System**: Raises alerts or sends notifications for flagged transactions.
7. **Monitoring**: All activities are monitored using Kibana.
